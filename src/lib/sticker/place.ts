// Where a sticker lands, how big it may be, and every clamp the sticker layer's gestures need
// (M7). The sticker analogue of `day/place.ts` — same shape, different box. Pure math: no React,
// no Dexie, no DOM.
//
// The coordinate model (M7 decision 1, load-bearing):
//   - Stickers are normalized to the **day-grid bounding box** — the `7·cellW × 6·cellH` rect
//     that already exists IDENTICALLY in both calendar views. It is the only rect that survives
//     a close-up ↔ full-month switch, and it is the rect M9's PNG export rasterizes.
//   - Its aspect therefore FALLS OUT of the cell's and is never hardcoded:
//     (7·cellW) / (6·cellH) = 7 / (6/CELL_ASPECT) = CELL_ASPECT² = 49/36.
//   - `pos_x`/`pos_y` ∈ [0,1] are the sticker's CENTER, as fractions of the grid's width and
//     height — the same center-based semantics as a stamp.
//   - `scale` is the sticker's WIDTH as a fraction of the GRID's width (so DEFAULT_SCALE = 1/7
//     is exactly one day cell wide). Its height follows from the image's own aspect.
//   - Internally we work in grid-width units (u): the grid is 1 wide and 1/GRID_ASPECT tall, so
//     both axes share one unit and rotation is honest.
//
// EVERY tunable number lives in STICKER (mirroring PLACEMENT). Retuning the feel is a one-object
// edit — the tests assert invariants (inside the grid, cascades, the 50-cap), never the numbers.
