// One-shot repair for stickers ingested before the alpha fix.
//
// The bug: `processImage` encoded EVERY thumb as JPEG. JPEG has no alpha channel, so a
// sticker's transparent pixels composited to **black** — and since the sticker layer renders
// from 256px thumbs (M7 decision 15), every placed sticker showed up as a black box. Photos were
// unaffected (no alpha to lose) and so were stamps (the day page draws their WebP closeups).
//
// Fixing the encoder only fixes stickers ingested from now on. The ones already on her device —
// the 3 seeded ones, and anything she uploaded — still hold a JPEG thumb locally AND have
// uploaded one to Storage. So: re-encode the thumb from the local `main` (which is a correct
// alpha PNG), point the `images` row at the new `.png` thumb path, and mark it dirty so push
// replaces the object in Storage too (uploads are idempotent — deterministic paths + upsert).
//
// Safe to run on every boot: a sticker whose thumb is already PNG costs one indexed read.
