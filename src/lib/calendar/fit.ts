 * The M8 frame wraps the weekday header + grid, and is charged **per edge**, by one rule: a ring
 * edge that sits at the block's outer boundary may overhang into the GUTTER — which is currently
 * just empty breathing room — while an edge facing interior chrome must be paid for.
 *
 *  • **Left, right and bottom are free.** Those ring edges ARE the block's outer edge, so the
 *    inset from the viewport becomes `max(GUTTER, frame)`, never `GUTTER + frame`. Every ring is
 *    ≤ 24px at phone scale, so `cellW` on a phone is bit-identical with and without a frame.
 *    This is "never fights her", and it is the assertion that would regress silently.
 *
 *  • **The top edge is charged.** It is the one ring edge NOT at the boundary — the month title
 *    sits above it — so there is no gutter there to overhang into, and `frameH` joins the height
 *    overhead alongside the title and header.
